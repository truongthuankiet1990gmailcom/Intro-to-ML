## Project Overview
This project follows a practical machine learning development cycle, structured in three iterative phases:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understanding the dataset, handling missing values, encoding, normalization, and feature engineering.

### Model Development
Building models using various frameworks (Scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow, XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost) and training them with suitable hyperparameters.

### Model Evaluation
Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, AUC-ROC, RMSE), analyzing errors, and refining the model.
